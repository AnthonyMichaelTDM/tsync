A utility to generate types for other typed languages.

Currently, only typescript is supported.


# Install

There are two parts to this:

1. A global CLI tool:

   ```
   cargo install tsync
   ```

2. The dependency for rust projects (to use the `#[tsync]` attribute; see usage below)

   ```
   /// Cargo.toml
 
   tsync = "X.Y.Z"
   ```

# Usage

Mark structs with `#[tsync]` as below:

```rust
/// src/main.rs
use cargo_tsync::{tsync};

#[tsync]
struct Book {
  name: String,
  chapters: Vec<Chapter>
}

#[tsync]
struct Chapter {
  title: String,
  pages: u32
}
```

Then use the tool:

```sh
cargo tsync -i **/*.rs -o types.d.ts
```

And voil√†!

```ts
/// types.d.ts

interface Book {
  name: string
  chapters: Array<Chapter>
}

interface Chapter {
  title: string
  pages: number
}
```
